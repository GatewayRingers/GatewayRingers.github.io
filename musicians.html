  <li class="pv2" id="Carl"><strong>♩ Carl Zimmerman</strong> is a charter member of The
  Gateway Ringers.  He began ringing handbells more than 35 years ago, when
  the church he attended was given a two octave set—his expertise on tower
  bells led to his being drafted as the first director of a brand new handbell
  choir, so all learned together.  Since then he has rung in or directed several
  other handbell choirs in various Presbyterian churches.  He is a retired USAF weather officer, a retired
  computer systems analyst, the Webmaster for <a class="link blue dim" href="http://www.towerbells.org/">TowerBells.org</a>,
  a tenor in the St.Louis
  Symphony Chorus and his church choir, and the expert to consult on the history and work of bellfounders
