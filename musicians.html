            Gateway Ringers.  He began ringing handbells more than 35 years ago, when
            the church he attended was given a two octave set - his expertise on tower
            bells led to his being drafted as the first director of a brand new handbell
            choir, so all learned together.  Since then he has rung in or directed several
            other handbell choirs, especially at his church home for over 30 years -
            Webster Groves Presbyterian.  He is a retired USAF weather officer, a retired
            computer systems analyst, the Webmaster for <a href="http://www.towerbells.org/">TowerBells.org</a>,
	    a tenor in the St.Louis
            Symphony Chorus and his church choir, and the expert to consult on the history and work of bellfounders
            in St.Louis.  He and his wife are parents of two and grandparents of six.
